# Pseudo-random Arrow Sequence Mini-game (2026)

I have learned and grown a lot throughout my academic experience but was inspired by the previous project which can be clearly observed in the various functions utilised.

The process of programming the core gameplay loop was plagued by consistent iterative problem solving which overall took approximately two to three weeks. A countdown with a progress bar visual speeds up alongside the players progress, to create challenge through a sense of panic, whilst the button sequences the player must input change in both variation and amount.

This mini-game was presented to Tobias Bowery, shown to Matthew Lawson-Hall and developed within Unity 2022.3.34f1.

Assets Utilised: Rewired & LeanTween
